# Predicting-Customer-Churn
Churn is when a customer stops doing business or ends a relationship with a company. To retain valuable customers and get ahead of the competition, it's common to build a customer churning prediction model to take proactive action.

Objective: create a customer churning model 
Source: Telco Churn Dataset 

Outline:
Exploratory data analysis
Feature engineering/selection
Normalization of features
Modeling (SMOTE for imbalance data; as the churn and not churn data are imbalanced, SMOTE is used to oversampling the minority data)
Evalualtion of performance
Model tuning
